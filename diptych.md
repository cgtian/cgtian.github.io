**Untitled Diptych**  
<br/><br/>
1\.  
<br/>
Before I was born, I dreamed of an ocean  
  
with water the color of jade  
churning beneath a field of formless clouds.  

<br/>
A wave falls against the shore  
and surges briefly over sand  
before retreating  
to be reclaimed by the undertow.  
  
Another wave falls against the shore.  

<br/>
As time passes  
the breakers keep rolling in.  
  
Their sound  
  
it feels like breathing.  

<br/>
The ocean is a giant in repose.  
<br/><br/><br/>
2\.  
<br/>
It’s quiet  
beneath the surface.  
  
I’ve been floating here  
for&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I don’t know how long.  
  
While peering into  
these interminable, jade-colored depths.  
  
And feeling like I’m falling in place.  

<br/>
When I look up, I see a large ring of pale light  
with a dull shimmer  
formed between the creases of passing waves.  
  
As they march on endlessly  
and wash away&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each in its turn  
I, me, and myself.  
  
In the clarity that remains  
a body starts swimming for the surface.  

<br/>
The light’s getting closer.  
  
Water runs cool over skin.  
  
There’s something burning where it shouldn’t.  
  
The mind’s forced back into the body.  

<br/>
I need air.  
  
But panic is swirling around me.  
  
I’m still reaching for the other side.  
  
Even as I feel my heartbeat fading.  

<br/>
For a moment, it’s all silence.  
  
Then I breathe  
and the waves are roaring.  
  
In the sky  
I see the remnants of a dream.
