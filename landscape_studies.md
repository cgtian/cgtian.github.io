**Landscape Studies**  
<br/><br/>
1: It was as if an endless brown cloth had been thrown against the night sky. Sleep must have  
eluded the sun then, because a soft light pressed against the cover, turning it a muted orange. A  
thin layer of clouds hung underneath.  
<br/><br/><br/>
2: Only stillness remained in the flatlands. The dirt was soft and covered everything but the sky,  
which was calm and blue. A solitary cloud floated in the distance. Everything was still.  
<br/><br/><br/>
3: While the sky was still thinly colored, with orange at the bottom and blue all above, a factory  
with tall smokestacks rose up at the end of a street with long rows of buildings on either side.  
Grey smoke – somewhat dark at the center but sun-touched at the fringe – rolled out of the  
stacks. A little cloud was forming amongst the rooftops, puffing outwards slowly.  
<br/><br/><br/>
5: Nomadic flames burned softly in the night.  
<br/><br/><br/>
7: The grass continues down the mountainside until everything disappears beneath the clouds.  
Now behemoths growing close, though they were wisps just earlier this morning, that blew into  
the valley and started to proliferate.  
<br/><br/><br/>
8: The clouds are surging.  
<br/><br/><br/>
9: Down below, verdant fields traverse the flatlands. Then start rolling up a distant slope. The  
crest of which gives way to mountains – a trio of long, dark ridges – each one higher than the  
last.  
  
Sitting in the shade of clouds that could be mountains unto themselves. Whose many forms, with  
unremembered names, are sprawling. And fill the foreground with a sense of grey.  
  
The sky beneath the clouds is hazy. As are the mountains down below. Such that everything feels  
tenuous. In a haze of pale canary gold.  
<br/><br/><br/>
10: In the distance beyond the grassy hills, there is a bridge – a long arc of concrete spanning  
something. Standing alone, empty. Surrounded by a grey sky.  
<br/><br/><br/>
11: The black mountains cut across the middle. To settle under the glare of a bright sun on a  
clear day. Where clouds are streaming over the lowest ridges. And into a new valley growing,  
over the mountains as they slowly disappear.  
<br/><br/><br/>
12: The tree's branches curved gently, as if they had imprinted in themselves the shape of the wind.  
<br/><br/><br/>
13: An unceasing wind is blowing in the desert. Where the night sky  
reveals itself as a blue dream. Sparsely laid brush extends for miles  
all around. A mountain fades into the darkness like a mirage.
