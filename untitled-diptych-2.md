**Untitled Diptych 2**  
<br/><br/>
1\.  
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I still  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; remember  
when my future self &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; first  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; splintered &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from me.  
<br/>
My ghost &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; made its way  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the moon.
