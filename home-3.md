**Home #3**  
<br/><br/>
Itâ€™s night. The blinds are closed. The room is lost in darkness.  
  
Everything is still.  

<br/>
The light comes in through the cracks above the blinds. Pale and  
white, spreading slowly across the ceiling. And into the shadows,  
of a room once again filled with solid objects.  

<br/>
White stripes are left in the wake of waves pushing inland.  
  
The walls have become awash in light and shadow.  

<br/>
Two trees stand outside the window. Sunlight filters through their  
leaves.  

<br/>
The sun is strongest now and illuminates new things. The many  
creases that run along wrinkled sheets. A falling grain against the  
wood. And reflections living on the surface of a glass bottle.  

<br/>
Tree leaves cast their shadows, against the light upon the wall.  
Whose surface tends to shimmer, when the leaves flutter in the  
wind.  

<br/>
The waves are receding.  

<br/>
What remains of the light is silver. A quiet presence in the room.  
That blurs the boundaries between and makes objects feel  
insubstantial. Such that they fade into the walls. The same walls  
becoming bare. In the periphery of a room, where emptiness starts  
to blossom.
