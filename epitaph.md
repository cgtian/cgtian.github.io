**Epitaph**  
<br/><br/>
It’s early. A light rain is falling over the lake.  

<br/>
From here, the shoreline extends in both directions. Only to  
disappear beyond the periphery.  
  
And reappear on the other side. Running before verdant hills lined  
with many trees. Whose leafy crowns carry with them vague  
memories of the tropics.  

<br/>
The hills are growing into mountains.  

<br/>
More rain falls.  
  
A thin layer of fog appears between grass-covered peaks.  

<br/>
The fog is descending. A long breath exhaled. Mountains turn  
slowly into shadows.  

<br/>
Solitude settles amongst the trees.  
  
While the grey, formless and pale, approaches.  

<br/>
It’s all fog beyond the lake now. A massive field is drifting closer.  
Followed by a distant voice promising erasure.  
  
The rain is so loud.  

<br/>
In time, the lake will disappear. It’s already halfway gone.  

<br/>
The waves wash in gently. Sounds are starting to dull. Numbness  
pervades.  

<br/>
Wisps of grey appear at the fringe. Eating slowly through what  
little remains. Until there’s nothing left.
