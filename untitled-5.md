**Untitled #5**  
<br/><br/>
I'm breathing.  
  
Boundaries dissolve into air.  
  
The night is a blue void.  

<br/>
A white fissure rips down through the sky. Racing the roar of the  
thunderclap. As both plummet towards the earth. And strike with  
blistering force against the ground.  
  
Two other bolts blink in and out of existence. Leaving behind faint  
imprints in the dark. That linger, for a moment, before fading. Just  
as the thunder breaks again.  
  
The storm continues for hours.  

<br/>
I see a blue field in the aftermath. A vague memory is floating  
above it like a ghost. Suddenly, the night flickers. And the ghost  
disappears.  
  
My mind wanders the expanse, searching for proof of what had  
come before. But silence is all that remains.
