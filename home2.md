**Home #2**  
<br/><br/>
The road is flat and wide such that one can see past the end, of the pavement and the trees, where  
a mountain stands beneath the sky which is orange and purple and fading. With the knowledge  
that the view, when facing the other way, is the same and I am living in a town surrounded by  
mountains.
