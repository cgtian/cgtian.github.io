**Untitled Triptych (Draft)**  
<br/><br/>
1.  
I wake up in the field  
trying to blink away  
the sleep still in my eyes.  
  
The morning is bright  
my eyelids are heavy  
the world can wait  
a while longer.  
  
I curl back into a ball  
atop my bed of grass  
as time bends slowly backwards.  
  
The light  
as I shrink  
is golden.  
  
It envelops me  
and I feel warm.  
  
There's peace  
to be found  
in the silence.  
  
And time  
to become again  
a little heart beating  
in my mother's womb.

2.  
Before I was born, I dreamed of an ocean  
  
with water the color of jade  
churning beneath a field of formless clouds.  
<br/><br/>
A wave falls against the shore  
and surges briefly over sand  
before retreating  
to be reclaimed by the undertow.  
  
Another wave falls against the shore.  
<br/><br/>
As time passes  
the breakers keep rolling in.  
  
Their sound  
  
it feels like breathing.  
<br/><br/>
The ocean is a giant in repose.

3.  
It’s quiet  
beneath the surface.  
  
I’ve been floating here  
for&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I don’t know how long.  
  
While peering into  
these interminable, jade-colored depths.  
  
And feeling like I’m falling in place.  
<br/><br/>
When I look up, I see a large ring of pale light  
with a dull shimmer  
formed between the creases of passing waves.  
  
As they march on endlessly  
and wash away&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each in its turn  
I, me, and myself.  
  
In the clarity that remains  
a body starts swimming for the surface.  
<br/><br/>
The light’s getting closer.  
  
Water runs cool over skin.  
  
There’s something burning where it shouldn’t.  
  
The mind’s forced back into the body.  
<br/><br/>
I need air.  
  
But panic is swirling around me.  

An obscured image&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the world above.  
  
I think I’m&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; passing out.  
<br/><br/>
For a moment, it’s all silence.  
  
Then I breathe  
and the waves are roaring.  
  
In the sky  
I see the remnants of a dream.
