**Jeune Finlandaise (1907)**  
<br/><br/>
She's sitting quietly on the stool  
with her hands clasped together  
waiting for something to happen.  
  
In her arms, I see the union of ice and vitality  
turquoise, baby blue, and fire.  
  
She looks off to the side  
observing the changing light  
with cobalt eyes that pierce before healing.
