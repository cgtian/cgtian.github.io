**Home**  
<br/><br/>
A white door is standing in the middle. As I walk towards it, I see  
the walls around me brushed with pale light. The door opens  
easily. And I am outside.  
  
The porch feels warm beneath my feet. Its wooden planks form a  
small bridge to the grass beyond. An untamed field stretches  
towards the horizon.  
<br/><br/><br/>

<br/><br/><br/>
She's sitting quietly on the stool  
with her hands clasped together  
waiting for something to happen.  
  
In her arms, I see the union of ice and vitality  
turquoise, baby blue, and fire.  
  
She looks off to the side  
observing the changing light  
with cobalt eyes that pierce before healing.  
<br/><br/><br/>
<hr style="width:2%">
<br/><br/><br/>
I'm breathing.  
  
Boundaries dissolve into air.  
  
The night is a blue void.  
<br/><br/>
A white fissure rips down through the sky. Racing the roar of the  
thunderclap. As both plummet towards the earth. And strike with  
blistering force against the ground.  
  
Two other bolts blink in and out of existence. Leaving behind faint  
imprints in the dark. That linger, for a moment, before fading. Just  
as the thunder breaks again.  
  
The storm continues for hours.  
<br/><br/>
I see a blue field in the aftermath. A vague memory is floating  
above it like a ghost. Suddenly, the night flickers. And the ghost  
disappears.  
  
My mind wanders the expanse, searching for proof of what had  
come before. But silence is all that remains.  
<br/><br/><br/>
<hr style="width:2%">
<br/><br/><br/>
I wake up in the field  
trying to blink away  
the sleep still in my eyes.  
  
The morning is bright  
my eyelids are heavy  
the world can wait  
a while longer.  
  
I curl back into a ball  
atop my bed of grass  
as time bends slowly backwards.  
  
The light  
as I shrink  
is golden.  
  
It envelops me  
and I feel warm.  
  
There's peace  
to be found  
in the silence.  
  
And time  
to become again  
a little heart beating  
in my mother's womb.
