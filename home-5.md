**Home #5**  
<br/><br/>
A white door is standing in the middle. As I walk towards it, I see  
the walls around me brushed with pale light. The door opens  
easily. And I am outside.  
  
The porch feels warm beneath my feet. Its wooden planks form a  
small bridge to the grass beyond. An untamed field stretches  
towards the horizon.
