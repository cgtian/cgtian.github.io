**Invocation**  
<br/><br/>
Night falls.  

<br/>
Iâ€™m sitting inside a circle  
drawn in red earth  
by the fire burning at its center.  

<br/>
The wood crackles  
sending a wave into the darkness  
only to have it wither in the flatlands  
and never reach the mountains that lie beyond.  
  
There are ghosts in those mountains.  

<br/>
I call to them  
  
but they don't respond.  
  
Still I think of all that they were.  

<br/>
Something invisible stirs atop the ridgeline.  
  
It could be nothing  
or a shadow descending.  
  
I hope they're all together.  

<br/>
In the distance, a zephyr glides across the earthen floor.  

<br/>
I can see the umbra now  
shrouded in its own darkness  
floating through the vast expanse between the mountains and here.  

<br/>
The shadow is approaching.  
  
Soon it'll reach the light's edge.  

<br/>
As it crosses the threshold  
the shadow starts to unravel  
revealing a human silhouette.  
  
At first, there's only one.  
  
Then one becomes two.  
  
And two become many.  
  
They walk silently through the circle  
memories bathed in the fire's light.  
  
My ancestors have returned.  
  
We're all together again.
